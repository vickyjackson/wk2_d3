# Homework

1. Look at the snakes and ladders sample solution.
2. Find out how to run the game (it should print out results to the terminal).
3. Try to draw a class diagram of this solution.
4. Think about the following questions and bring your answers for tomorrow's homework review.

### Questions to consider:

- Are there any parts you don't understand?
  * The TurnLog initialise method - never seen this syntax before :-(
- Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
  * Because it's just calling a Ruby method and we hope those have been tested already ;-)
- Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
  * The viewer class is our front-end
  * Separation of concerns
  * Front-end can be switched out for another interface!
